//Content in this will be used to create a JWT token for the user after signing up. The token will be used to authenticate the user in subsequent requests. The token will be signed with a secret key and will contain the user's id and role. The token will be sent to the client and will be stored in local storage. The client will send the token in the authorization header in subsequent requests. The server will verify the token and extract the user's id and role from it. The server will then use this information to authorize the user to access the requested resource.
//This feature will be addded soon
